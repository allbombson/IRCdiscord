# IRCdiscord

An IRCd that lets you talk to Discord users
Essentially an IRC server that connects to Discord to relay messages between an IRC client and Discord.

# Capabilities
Listed below are current features.
- /whois gives information on discord users
- DM support
- Talk in any server/channel
- /list lists all channels in server

# Installation
Build with `go build` and then copy into your $PATH. You can also grab a prebuilt binary above.

# Usage
Run the program, and in your IRC client, connect to `127.0.0.1` with the server password being `<your discord token>:<target discord server id>`.

An example for weechat:
```
/server add discordserver -password=lkajf_343jlksaf43wjalfkjdsaf:348734324
/set irc.server.discordserver.capabilities "server-time"
/set irc.server.discordserver.autoconnect on
/set irc.server.discordserver.autojoin "#channel1,#channel2,#channel3"
